# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
`Imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` libraries were used to build and evaluate models using resampling techniques. The credit card credit dataset used in this analysis was provided by a peer-to-peer services lending company called LendingClub. Various data sampling techniques were performed using the following algorithms with its respective sampling technique indicated: `RandomOverSampler` (oversampling), `SMOTE` (oversampling), `ClusterCentroids` (undersampling), and `SMOTEENN` (combination of over and undersampling). Then two new machine learning models intended to predict credit risk with reduced bias called, `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `EasyEnsembleClassifier`, were compared.

## Results
Below are the results of the **balanced accuracy scores** and the **precision and recall scores** of all six machine learning models.

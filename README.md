# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
`Imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` libraries were used to build and evaluate models using resampling techniques. The credit card credit dataset used in this analysis was provided by a peer-to-peer services lending company called LendingClub. Various data sampling techniques were performed using the following algorithms: `RandomOverSampler` (oversampling), `SMOTE` (oversampling), `ClusterCentroids` (undersampling), and `SMOTEEN` (combination). Then two new machine learning models intended to predict credit risk with reduced bias called, `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `EasyEnsembleClassifier`, were compared.
